      "description": "Located on the Guwahati-Shillong highway in the commercial and cultural heart of the capital of Assam, Vivanta Guwahati is an urban retreat designed for global business travellers, adventurers and connoisseurs of the good life. Offering world-class comforts in an environment with a strong local character, our 5 star hotel in Guwahati is uniquely positioned as a gateway to the Seven Sisters (the seven scintillating North East Indian states). Five acres of manicured gardens, betel nut groves and water bodies usher guests into a space awash with motifs that evoke the soul of Assam. The striking entrance to the main building which houses 150 contemporary rooms and suites is modelled after Rang Ghar, the royal amphitheatre of the mighty Ahom dynasty. Design inspiration is further drawn from the cupola (rounded dome) of the Kamakhya Temple, the gamocha handloom reflected in a modern bamboo interweave, Xingkhap patterns in the rooms, a stunning mural of 1008 cascading sacred bells in the grand lobby and marigold motifs across the hotel. Live the lifestyle of modern-day royals while dining at our specialty restaurants serving avant-garde Chinese, Japanese and classic North and South Indian cuisines. Our secret gastronomic weapon is authentic Assamese cuisine which leverages the Brahmaputra River and valley’s exceptional produce, giving guests a taste of the sub-continent’s rarest ingredients and cooking techniques. Entertain important business guests at our elegant Executive Lounge, and post-wrap up, party with Guwahati’s glitterati at Octave, the glamorous bar lounge. A workout at our 24/7 state-of-the-art Fitness Centre followed by a few laps in the outdoor swimming pool and a relaxing treatment at the award-winning Jiva Spa keep you in top form. Our hotel in Guwahati has an independent convention complex that offers the largest banqueting spaces in the Northeast for business and social events. Our Concierge service’s insider knowledge guides you in exploring the best that Assam has to offer. From participating in joyful bihu dance performances on the hotel lawns, shopping for exquisite silk mekhala chadors (the traditional Assamese dress) at the weavers village of Sualkuchi, sunset dinners on the Brahmaputra and tours of Assam’s world-class tea gardens to exploring the UNESCO World Heritage wildlife parks – Kaziranga and Manas – Vivanta Guwahati puts a special spin on your discovery of Assam and the Seven Sisters.",
